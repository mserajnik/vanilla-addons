[SIZE=3][b]OneBag[/b][/SIZE]

[b]Description:[/b]
OneBag is a replacement for the default game bags that combines all the bags into one frame.  There are already addons out there that do this, so why OneBag? Mainly because I wanted a simpler, more system-friendly bag. OneBag doesn't entirely rewrite the bag-handling interface like others do. It simply rearranges the bags into one and allows the default UI to continue managing the bag slots. This means that addons such as KC_Items, ItemSync, LootLink, and SellValue should be inherently supported. As long as an addon is compatible with the default game bags, it should work with OneBag. This was my goal, anyway. For my uses OneBag has succeeded. Hopefully you will have similar results.

[b]A Couple of Notes:[/b][list]
[*]This mod does rely on the Ace2 embedable framework.  Ace2 is the next generation of the Ace line, and does not require an external Ace2 addon as a dependency.  
[*]Slot highlighting will not work properly in a locale that is not currently offered.  If you want to help remedy this problem then please contact me to help aid in the last few translations.
