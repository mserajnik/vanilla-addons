  This is a template for the plugin/module system for Clique.

  Plugins are typically used to tie Clique to a specific set of unit frames, but 
  can also be used to add functionality to the system through a manner of hooks.
  
  Plugins are registered with Clique with a shortname that is used for all slash
  commands.  In addition they are required to have a fullname parameter that is
  used in all display messages

-- Create a new plugin for Clique, with the shortname "test"
local Plugin = Clique:NewModule("ora2mtf")
Plugin.fullname = "oRA2_MainTankFrames"

-- Plugin:Test() is called anytime the mod tries to enable.  It is optional
-- but it will be checked if it exists.  Will typically be based off some global
-- or the state of the addon itself.
function Plugin:Test()
    return oRADB
end

-- Plugin:OnEnable() is called if Plugin:Test() is true, and the mod hasn't been explicitly
-- disabled.  This is where you should handle all your hooks, etc.
function Plugin:OnEnable()
    oRA_MainTankFramesCustomClick = self.OnClick
end

-- Plugin:OnDisable() is called if the mod is enabled and its being explicitly disabled.
-- This function is optional.  If it doesn't exist, Plugin:UnregisterAllEvents() and
-- Plugin:UnregisterAllHooks().

    oRA_MainTankFramesCustomClick = nil

    if not Clique:OnClick(button, unit) then
        if button == "LeftButton" then
            TargetUnit(unit.."target")
